# Introduction

This is an implementation of a scene rendered in cuda. Specifically, this looks to implement a series of operations on meshes used to render the scene. 
Execution time is important in this case, so we need to look at implementing this as parallely as possible. 

# Code

The file containing the mesh operations will be in code/main.cu

# Execution

sh test.sh should work well enough.
